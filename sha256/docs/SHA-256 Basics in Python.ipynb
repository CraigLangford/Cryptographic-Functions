    "# Writing SHA-256 in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 has become an incredibly useful cryptographic function. It has the capability to convert any data into a unique 32-byte string (256 bits respectively). The real magic comes from its following two properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any change in the incoming data will produce a completely new and unique 32-byte string (if two pieces of data can produce the same string it is called a collision and can be an enormous security problem)\n",
    "2. The original data cannot be reproduced from the hash, therefore the function is one directional. This means the hash can be shared freely without any fear of the original data being \n",
    "\n",
    "<img class=\"image\" src=\"{{ site.url }}/assets/images/sha256/diagram.png\" alt=\"SHA-256 Basics\">\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly does it do this? Well, lets make our own SHA-256 function to find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pretty easy to start, we just need a function to take in any data that can be converted to binary. In this example we'll limit our data to string values for representation sake. With this we can easily convert teach value to it's unicode code point by using Python's `ord()` function and convert this integer to binary by using Python 3's format function."
